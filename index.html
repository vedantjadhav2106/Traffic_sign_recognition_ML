  <title>Traffic Sign Recognition System (Machine Learning)

 <body>
  <h1>The	main	objective	of	our	project	is	to	design	and	construct	a	computer	based	system	which	can	
automatically	detect	the	road	signs	so	as	to	provide	assistance	to	the	user	or	the	machine	so	that	
they	can	 take	appropriate	actions.	The	proposed	approach	consists	of	building	a	model	using	
convolutional	neural	networks	by	extracting	traffic	signs	from	an	image	using	color	information.	
We have used	convolutional	neural	networks	(CNN)	to	classify	the	traffic	signs	and	we	used	color	
based	segmentation	to	extract/crop	signs	from	images</h1>
